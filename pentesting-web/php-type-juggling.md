# PHP Type juggling

PHP does not require (or support) explicit type definition in variable declaration; a variable's type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. That is to say, if a string value is assigned to variable $var, $var becomes a string. If an int value is then assigned to $var, it becomes an int.

An example of PHP's automatic type conversion is the multiplication operator '\*'. If either operand is a float, then both operands are evaluated as floats, and the result will be a float. Otherwise, the operands will be interpreted as ints, and the result will also be an int. Note that this does _not_ change the types of the operands themselves; the only change is in how the operands are evaluated and what the type of the expression itself is.
